# Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Prediction using Machine Learning

Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) are critical to understanding cellular functions, disease mechanisms, and drug target identification. This project explores **machine learning-based techniques** to predict and analyze PPIs using molecular features, binding patterns, and interaction networks.

##  Overview

- **What are PPIs?**
  Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) are associations between protein molecules that perform biological functions. These interactions are fundamental to cell signaling, immune response, and metabolic pathways.

- **Challenges:**
  - Highly dynamic nature (transient vs stable interactions)
  - Complex and high-dimensional biological data
  - Need for accurate, generalizable ML models

---

##  Objectives

- Predict whether two proteins interact
- Identify probable binding sites
- Estimate binding affinity scores
- Model large-scale interaction networks

---

##  Machine Learning Approaches

- **Classical Models:**
  - SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression
- **Deep Learning:**
  - CNNs for sequence analysis
  - Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for structural modeling
  - Transformers for contextual residue embeddings

---

##  Features Used

- Protein sequence (FASTA)
- Amino acid composition
- Domain-domain interactions
- Structural similarity (3D coordinates)
- Co-evolutionary signals
- Docking scores
